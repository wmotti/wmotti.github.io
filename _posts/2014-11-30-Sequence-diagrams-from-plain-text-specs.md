Focus on what matters and stop worrying about style and layout of your
sequence-diagrams, give [seqdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html "seqdiag") a
try!

It generates an image of your sequence-diagram from a plain text source file, similar to graphviz's DOT files.

An additional plus: as diffs between plain text files are easily readable,
your sequence-diagrams versioning will be a nicer experience :wink:

And if you need a different UML diagram, take a look at the other similar tools in
[blockdiag](http://blockdiag.com "blockdiag.com").
