For everyone interested in web application security, check
[SecCasts](https://seccasts.com) by [nVisium](https://nvisium.com).

You will find many screencasts explaining and exploiting the most common
and dangerous [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) security threats like SQL
injection, XSS, CSRF and session fixation.

Some screencasts focus on Rails and Grails frameworks, while others are
more general: have a look, for example, at the "Intro to web hacking"
series.

As a demonstration tool, the intercepting proxy [Burp
Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) is used in almost every screencast.
